# Examples

This section provides practical examples of using the Manas framework for various applications. Each example includes fully documented code and explanations.

## Basic Examples

- [Simple Q&A](/examples/simple-qa/) - Basic question-answering with a single agent
- [Multi-Agent Conversation](/examples/multi-agent-conversation/) - Creating conversational agents that interact with each other
- [Tool Usage](/examples/tool-usage/) - Integrating tools with agents

## Flow Examples

- [Research Assistant](/examples/research-assistant/) - A flow that researches, analyzes, and summarizes information
- [Code Generator](/examples/code-generator/) - Using multiple agents to design, implement, and test code
- [Content Creation](/examples/content-creation/) - A workflow for creating and refining content

## RAG Examples

- [Knowledge Base Q&A](/examples/knowledge-base-qa/) - Answering questions based on a knowledge base
- [Document Analysis](/examples/document-analysis/) - Analyzing and extracting insights from documents
- [Multi-Source RAG](/examples/multi-source-rag/) - Using multiple data sources in a RAG system

## Advanced Examples

- [Complex Workflows](/examples/complex-workflows/) - Building and managing complex multi-agent workflows
- [Custom Vector Stores](/examples/custom-vector-stores/) - Implementing and using custom vector stores
- [Integration Examples](/examples/integrations/) - Integrating Manas with external services and APIs

Each example can be run directly from the provided code and serves as a practical reference for implementing similar functionality in your own applications.
