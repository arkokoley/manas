# Manas

Manas is a powerful, flexible framework for building LLM-powered applications with intelligent agents, task decomposition, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The framework is designed to help developers create complex AI applications by orchestrating multiple AI agents working together to solve problems.

## Why Manas?

In the rapidly evolving landscape of LLM applications, developers face several challenges:

- **Complexity Management**: Coordinating multiple AI components and tasks
- **Model Flexibility**: Supporting various LLM providers and models
- **RAG Integration**: Integrating knowledge bases effectively
- **Scalability**: Building systems that can grow with your needs
- **Tooling**: Connecting AI with external tools and APIs

Manas addresses these challenges with a unified framework that lets you define multi-agent systems, manage workflows, integrate knowledge bases, and connect to external toolsâ€”all with a clean, consistent API.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Define and coordinate multiple agents with different roles and capabilities
- **Flexible LLM Integration**: Support for OpenAI, Anthropic, HuggingFace, and more
- **Built-in RAG**: First-class support for Retrieval-Augmented Generation with various vector stores
- **Flow-Based Architecture**: Create complex workflows with directed graphs
- **Tool Integration**: Connect agents to external tools and APIs
- **Extensible Design**: Easily add new capabilities and integrations

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example to get you started:

```python
from core import LLM, Agent

# Initialize a model
model = LLM.from_provider(
    "openai",
    model_name="gpt-4",
    api_key="your-api-key"  # Or use environment variable
)

# Create an agent
agent = Agent(llm=model)

# Generate a response
response = agent.generate("Explain what the Manas framework does")
print(response)
```

## Installation

```bash
pip install manas-ai
```

For specific features:

```bash
# OpenAI support
pip install "manas-ai[openai]"

# Full installation with CPU support
pip install "manas-ai[all-cpu]"

# Full installation with GPU support
pip install "manas-ai[all-gpu]"
```

## Next Steps

1. Follow the [Getting Started Guide](/getting-started/) for a complete introduction
2. Explore [Core Concepts](/concepts/) to understand the architecture
3. Check out [Examples](/examples/) for practical use cases
4. Read the [API Reference](/api/) for detailed documentation
